# Email_and_password phishing templates to replace  with the deafult content in /ag1/www/ when evil twin attack is running
- The templates can be tested on you own router, OR by deauth a Hotel / School etc router, OR by name you (portable) router to Hotel/School AP to fake a senario 100% legit by show target AP name displayed as available AP,insted of a router name.
- The https_plugin.os used in images and show slightly different from phone to phone
- Only hackers mind limited way of use.
  e.g  QR code was used to test "consert".
- airgeddon https plugin  templates bypass http warnings etc. Whiteout https-plugin templates still capture credentials & avoid check.php, update.php etc to interrupt email_files.
- if you'r not sure how to replace the files, se video below to get an idé.
Video is in spanish, forget everything    else then how to replace all files in ag1/www folder. Code in video is very different and for AP password only.
 The www folder must bee open as root to replace all files in ag1/www folder.
- If any question hit mee up on Dicord , - - or use email found at github overview.
- Remenber, you only need to replace image - and text to test against other targets,    like a school or whatever
