- Busy with wpa3 testing until 7/11-25
- email-pishing as customportals on hold.
# Temporary_test_repo_for_Discord_friends
# Email_and_password phishing templates to replace  with the deafult content in /ag1/www/ when evil twin attack is running
- Run evil twin attack and replace content in ag1/www.
- The https_plugin is used in images.
- Only hackers mind limited way of use.
  e.g  QR code was used to test "consert".
- airgeddon https plugin templates bypass http warnings etc. Whiteout https-plugin templates still capture credentials & avoid check.php/ update.php  so php files don't interrupt email_phishing files.
- if not sure how to replace the files, se video below to get an id√©.
Video is in spanish.Se "how to replace all files in ag1/www folder". Never mind other stuff as code in video is very different and only for AP password.
 The www folder must bee open as root to replace files in the ag1/www folder.
- For test against targets like a school or whatever, only change the img+ text.
Temporary repo will be replaced with a final email-pishing repo later.
- Email validation, confirme password etc is done, templates act legit for victims.
- Email & password typed will popup in a  txt file at /home/kali/Desktop.
- Images of the 2 phishing templates how they look for victims at his phone.
- If any question hit mee up on Dicord , -  or use email found at github overview.
